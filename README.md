## How to play
The main objective of this game is for the soldier to collect all the coins on his treasure. Each new round will spawn coins, flames and bombs. The bombs are the only killers here, so run from them. The flames wont kill the soldier, just take away his points, but don't fear, the soldier can slay the flame with his mighty strength.

To move the soldier, it's as simple as pressing the arrow keys.

- ‚Üë Up to jump
- ‚Üì Down while on air to fall faster
- ‚Üê Left to move left
- ‚Üí Right to move right

To attack just press the space key.

Have fun playing. Any feedback will be appreciated.
